Developed by Manuel Bravo

This is a short demo to showcase some of my work using Unreal Engine and the application of some concepts such as:

-Gameplay Mechanics: Sprinting (hold LShift), Jumping (Spacebar), Crouching (hold Ctrl), Shooting (Lmouse),
Aiming (mouse), Player Movement (WASD)

-Environmental Interactions and Physics: Triggers, gravity, object deconstruction

-UI: tutorial message for the player

-Lighting and Textures


This is a live project and am always looking to continue adding to it.
